# An introduction to a Random Dataset based on a real world Phenomenon:
In the attached Jupyter Notebook, randomly generated code based on suicide rates within Ireland from the years 2008 to 2018 are generated. The randomly generated data is generated between certain points or numbers to ensure it within the same range of the actual suicide rates recorded.


# How to Run Jupyter Notebook:
To run the script to invesigate the Numpy.random package and it's functions within Jupyter you must have already downloaded Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Python (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python).

1. Please find the script in the file Programing-for-data-analysis-project.ipynb within the Programming for Data Analysis project Depository. Copy this code and save to a new file or download it. Name it as you desire.
2. Open Visual Studio Code (VSC). To open the Integrated Terminal, click View and then click the integrated terminal or alternatively use the shortcut cntrl +'.
3. Type jupyter notebook into the Intergrated Terminal and press enter. A new internet tab will be opened.
4. In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab.
5. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by clicking on a cell and pressing shift + enter. An sterisk between two square brackets [*] will appear when the code is running. Once the code is run a number will appear between two square brackets eg [1].
6. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
7. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etc.).



# Conclusion:
In the notebook, 100 random samples are theoretically taken from Irish suicide rates over the last 10 years.Four variables are produced. These include age, gender, year and county (location).These reseults can be seen in the table above.

Data is generated to represent the total male and female sucide rates for each year from 2008 to 2018 based on the actual min and max values of the recorded suicide rates.

Each time the data is generated it should be different, from analysing the data you make notice a trend with certain counties, gender and age.
The average suicide rate for both male and female throughout the years is calculated.

Histograms are used to compare the random data generated.
